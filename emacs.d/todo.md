# To Do
Install projectile.
Install whichkey
Either save on blur, or display unsaved buffers?

## UI
Change font for non-editor buffers?
Get rid of the scrollbar on the right.
Top padding would be nice.
Make the bar less hideous.
Fix company mode whitespace faces.

## Menu
Play with Ivy settings, try to fix sort-order.
Ivy faces.

## Keybindings
Install Hydra. It would be nice to have those on top of the default key-bindings, I'd like to leave those in place as much as possible.

## Editing
Multiple cursors package.

Bind-keys/write functions for:
- duplicate current line
- move line up/down

## Clojure
Check out lsp-ui, bits of it may be useful.
When I have key-shortcuts/hydra set up, write a format function that 
- formats the entire file
- balances everything
- organises the namespaces
- other options if they exist

## Next Languages, Go/Zig
Pull out settings that only apply to dev-buffers (rm-trailing-whitespace, add-newline-on-save, highlight-whitespace) into a dev-mode function, or mode.

## Markdown
Faces.

## Documentation
Start writing down some shortcuts? or figure out how to quickly view them. I don't know how to use dired.

## Done
Make trailing spaces change the foreground, not background colour. 
Get rid of the line-wrapping chars.
Remove face for too-long-lines.
Fix face for dired padding.
Enable this thing: https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/efaq/Replacing-highlighted-text.html so you can overwrite selected text
Don't allow wrapping in the middle of a word.
Change the theme to make the whitespace marks only visible for leading/trailing whitespace, if possible. UPDATE: not possible, at least not easily
Shrink text a point or two.
